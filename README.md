## About the project

This repository hosts the source code of **MOSQUITO-NET: A Deep Learning based CADx system for malaria diagnosis along with model
interpretation using GradCam and CLass activation maps.**
This work
has been published in [Expert Systems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680394). https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12695

Automatic classification of malaria infected blood smears deep learning approaches can
be performed using the framework available here:
<https://malaria.zyik.ml/>.


## Mosquito-Net (Mish version)
Mosquito net with a different activation function [Mish](https://github.com/digantamisra98/Mish). Slightly improved performance.  

## Mosquito-Net V2 (Mobile version)
A more optimized version of MosquitoNet with Depthwise Seperable Convolutions for mobile devices accepted & presented in[*ICML 2020, MLGH Workshop Poster*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OoCqThpsm9N38eUTGNmxwRhVat8IxWVl/view)
